		<p>Recently an issue was raised in a Discord server that I am a moderator for; regarding a issue we had
			collectively noticed about our experiences with the Computer Science curriculum at our
			university. However, the conversation became more interesting when a few professors in the
			server joined the conversation and agreed with all of our observations, and provided their own
			experiences. We came to the conclusion that there might be a rather glaring problem with
			the Computer Science curriculum that seems to persist regardless of the effects it has on
			the students. This problem, while seemingly rather strange, is that there is too great a focus
			on high level concepts.</p>
		<p>I would not go so far as to say that there is no need for teaching of high level concepts, but it has
			created a glaring issue for computer science students. When I first started learning C and C++
			for a class on data structures and algorithm, I found the transition to using a Linux based
			system, and the GCC/G++ compiler fairly painless; this was not the case for others, and as I
			tutor for these mid-level classes now this issue remains. Many of the students I tutor have no
			clue what Linux is, some have never used a command line. These are some of the more extreme cases,
			but what seems to be the umbrella issue is that these students were never taught to use the tools
			vital to this field.</p>
		<p>Prior to my junior year of my undergraduate degree I did not even know how to use the GDB debugger,
			and this is a problem. When ones courses, assignments, and even their careers rely on the use of
			these basic tools, there is a question of why they are not taught. I spent the summer working on
			learning Linux, using GDB, learning GCC/G++, and other command line tools; what spurred this
			was that I realized that while I knew all the theory, structure, and high level standards for a
			creating a compiler, I could barely code one. The course that taught me the most, and helped to
			strengthen my skills was a course of software security. The reason, it was entirely on Linux;
			everything we did was on a Linux system, the compilation, the debugging, the creation, everything
			was in a Linux command line. It was a trial by fire, and it should not have been; it should have
			been as familiar as the color on my walls.</p>
		<p>The solution should be fairly simple, but presents a rather annoying logistical issue. Replace a class
			in the current curriculum with a course on these practical skills and
			tools, but what class? It is a difficult question, and not easily answered, there is no obvious or
			logical choice. The solution that I believe most befits the problem is a little more nuanced;</p>
